"""
This module implements the logic of the battle between the armies.
First we need to specify the number of armies, the number of units
of each army, the number of units in the unit of each army and the
strategy of fighting each army. After starting 2 random army that
would fight each other will be selected. Logic armies battle consists
in choosing the enemy army unit according to the strategy and attack
the last chance of the current army squad.
After the victory of one army over 2 random selected and the cycle repeats.
